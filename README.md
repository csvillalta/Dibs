# Dibs - Community Favorite Project at Tri-Co Hackathon 2018

Dibs addresses the theme of sustainability by giving leftovers a second chance at consumption; Dibs attempts to resolve this by creating a service that allows users to subscribe to a SMS/MMS feed where users can quickly send a picture and description of leftover food. Any user subscribed in the feed can then claim "dibs" on this food by simply texting the appropriate code.

Django hosts the database which holds the phone numbers in the network and the active food listings. Twilio implements the SMS/MMS functionality.
